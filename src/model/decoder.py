    Decoder module consisting of multiple layers of decoder blocks, each containing self-attention, 
    cross-attention with the encoder output, and feed-forward layers. It includes residual connections

    Args:
        layers (nn.Module): A list of DecoderBlock modules that will process the input sequentially.
    
    Methods:
        forward(x, encoder_output, src_mask, tgt_mask):
            Performs the forward pass through each decoder block, applying self-attention and cross-attention
            with the encoder output. Returns the normalized output after all layers are applied.

    Inputs:
        x (Tensor): Input sequence to the decoder (target sequence).
        encoder_output (Tensor): Output from the encoder (used in cross-attention).
        src_mask (Tensor): Mask for the source sequence (used in cross-attention to mask padding or unwanted tokens).
        tgt_mask (Tensor): Mask for the target sequence (used in self-attention to prevent attending to future tokens).

    Output:
        Tensor: The final output from the decoder after processing through all layers and normalization.
