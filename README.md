# Transformer-Based English to Yoruba Translator 🇳🇬

Welcome to the **NEPA-Transformer** ⚡ repository! This project implements a Transformer model from scratch, following the architecture laid out in the paper [*Attention is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The goal of this project is to create a model capable of translating text from English to Yoruba using the Transformer architecture.

> **Note**: This repo is a work-in-progress and in the coming weeks, I'll be organizing a more polished and final version, calling it the **NEPA-Transformer** ⚡. *(If you know, you know! 🇳🇬)*.

## Project Structure 🛠️

This project is organized to ensure modularity and ease of navigation. Coming soon!
