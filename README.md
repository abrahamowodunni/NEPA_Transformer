## Background

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enabling models to handle complex sequences and dependencies. This project focuses on developing a translation model specifically for the Yoruba language, addressing the challenges posed by its linguistic structure.

## Installation

To set up this project, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Install the necessary packages by following the instructions in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

Instructions on how to use the model for training and inference can be found in the documentation or main script files.

## Training

During the training process, we monitored key metrics such as training loss and attention visualizations. The training revealed important insights:

- The initial training showed a high loss that dropped sharply, indicating learning. However, erratic behavior towards the end suggested potential issues related to the learning rate and model complexity.
- Visualizations of the training loss displayed initial decreases but indicated instability in the later stages.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated based on translation accuracy and attention visualization. The attention maps indicated:

- Strong diagonal patterns in initial tokens, indicative of effective learning.
- Diffuse attention in later tokens, highlighting the need for improvement in handling long-range dependencies.

## Results

Despite facing challenges, the model showed promising results in translating basic phrases. The insights gained through this process are invaluable for future iterations.

## Future Work

Even though the results weren't perfect, I plan to take the following steps to improve the model:

1. **Complex Architecture:** Explore deeper layers and additional attention heads.
2. **More Data:** Incorporate larger datasets that focus on long-range content to enhance contextual understanding.
3. **Cloud Solutions:** Utilize cloud-based resources, like Paperspace, to scale training efforts efficiently.
4. **Regularization Techniques:** Implement dropout and label smoothing to mitigate overfitting.
